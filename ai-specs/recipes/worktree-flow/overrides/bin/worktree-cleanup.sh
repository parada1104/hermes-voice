# worktree-cleanup.sh — remove merged git worktrees under a configured directory.
#
# Removes each worktree located under <dir> whose branch is fully merged into
# the integration branch. Preserves worktrees that have uncommitted changes
# (dirty) or whose branch is not yet merged (unmerged). The main worktree and
# detached-HEAD worktrees are never touched.
#
# Under monorepo-submodules, enumerates each initialized submodule (never the
# superproject worktree list alone) and scans shared <worktrees_dir>/<module>-*
# linked worktrees. standalone / monorepo-apps keep a single-repo pass.
#
# Usage:
#   worktree-cleanup.sh [--dir <worktrees_dir>] [--base <integration_branch>]
#                       [--dry-run] [--topology <value>]
#                       [--submodule <path>|--subrepo <path>]...
#
# Defaults:
#   --dir   .worktrees
#   --base  current branch of each scanned repo (or --base when provided)
#   --topology  stamped sync value, else auto
#               (auto|standalone|monorepo-apps|monorepo-submodules)
#   --submodule / --subrepo  (none = all initialized submodules)
#
# Environment variables:
#   WORKTREE_CLEANUP_DEBUG=1       print debug messages to stderr
#   WORKTREE_CLEANUP_SOURCE_ONLY=1  (test helper) skip execution loop when sourced
# Output lines (stable, greppable):
#   removed <name>
#   would remove <name>            (with --dry-run)
#   skipped <name> (dirty)
#   skipped <name> (unmerged)
#   skipped <name> (detached)
